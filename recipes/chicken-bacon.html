    <h2>How to make Chicken Bacon Ranch Casserole</h2>

    <p>Recipe Tip: You can substitute Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella, and use any variety of pasta for the penne.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Arrange chicken breasts on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Dice chicken and place in a bowl; add ranch mix and stir until coated. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon into small pieces; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat reserved bacon grease in the skillet; cook and stir bell pepper until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add diced chicken, 1 jar Alfredo sauce, milk, and garlic; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the jar of remaining Alfredo sauce into a casserole dish; top with 1/2 of the penne, 1/2 of the chicken mixture, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 of the bacon. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients in the same order ending with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and bacon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole bubbles and cheese is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
